# Setting up a New Rig

Now that you've got Luminos running, let's connect Luminos to hardware.

We'll modify the `Example`.

<Steps>
### Edit the initializer
In MATLAB, open the `Example.json` file by running
```matlab
edit Example.json
```
Edit the file to use your hardware. Feel free to add only one device at a time, and we'll test that device in the next step.

```json filename="Example.json"

  "objectType": "Rig_Initializer",
  "dataDirectory": "C:\\Users\\Labmember\\Data",

    "Main",

    {

      "api_version": "alpV42x64",
      "frac_calpoints": [
        [0.55, 0.35],

        [0.3, 0.45]

    }
  ]
}
```

To find all the devices that Luminos supports, see the [Supported Hardware](./supported-devices) page. To find all the properties
that each device supports, you can open the Initializer file for that device (e.g. `DAQ_Initializer.m`).

### Add device drivers

- **Hamamatsu:** If you're using a Hamamatsu camera, you'll need to download both [DCAM-SDK4 and DCIMG-SDK on their website](https://dcam-api.com/sdk-download/).
  Create an account on the Hamamatsu website if you don't already have one.
  Unzip the folders and place them in `luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/`. You should have the following folders:

```
luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/dcamsdk4
luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/dcimgsdk
```

- **Andor:** If you're using an Andor camera, you'll need to download the [Andor SDK3 on their website](#). Unzip the folder and place it in `luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/`. You should have the following folder:

```
luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/Andor_SDK
```

- **Kinetix:** If you're using an Teledyne Kinetix camera, you'll need to download the [PVCAM SDK on their website](https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/pvcam-sdk-amp-driver/?model=PVCAM-SDK). Find the files **master.h**, **pvcam.h** and **version.h** (should be in 'PVCAM/inc') and place it in `luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/PVCAM/inc`. Then add the library **pvcam64.lib** (should be in 'PVCAM/lib') to the folder `luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/PVCAM/lib` You should have the following folders:

```
luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/PVCAM/inc containing **master.h**, **pvcam.h** and **version.h**
and 
luminos-microscopy/lib/Luminos_VS/inc/custom/PVCAM/lib containing **pvcam64.lib**
```

Luminos will check for drivers for each of these cameras in the specified location and enable the use of the camera types it finds there.

After you've added the drivers, you'll need to compile the C++ code. To do this, run in MATLAB

```matlab
build
```

### Testing the hardware

Now that you've added your hardware to the initializer, let's test it out. To test the camera, run in MATLAB

```
cam = Standalone_Device("Example", "Camera");
```

Your camera should hopefully launch without errors! Now try the other devices. If you run into any issues, please
let us know on the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/adamcohenlab/luminos-microscopy/issues).

### Running the full app

To run the full application, run in MATLAB

```matlab
app = Example_App();
```

And there you have it! You've got a working app. You can follow the next tutorial to learn how to customize the user interface.
