# Viewing Data

```matlab
[mov, avgImg, DeviceData] = Extract_Mov('path/to/data/folder');
imagesc(avgImg);
```

The camera data will be saved to 'frames1.bin', 'frames2.bin' for the second camera etc. 
All other experimental parameters, including input and output waveforms, DMD patterns, etc. will be present in 'output_data.mat'.
Note that various class definitions from 'luminos\src\Devices\DAQ\NI_DAQ' need to be present in the MATLAB path in order to 
properly view and plot the DAQ waveforms.
