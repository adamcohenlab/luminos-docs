# Creating Your Own Tab

We'll be creating a new tab that contains a stage controller. I assume you don't have familiarity with [React](https://react.dev),
the JavaScript library we use to create the user interface.

Before you start, I highly recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit files, especially for JavaScript,
and installing the [Copilot Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot-in-visual-studio-code)
— it's free for students and will make you code much faster.

<Steps>
### Run the app

As in the [Getting Started](./getting-started) tutorial, we run the simulator app.

```matlab copy
app = Simulator_App();
```

One nice part about React is we can make changes to the code while the app is running and we'll see the changes in real time.

### Creating a basic tab

In React, we use components to organize our code.

For our new tab, let's make a component called `Stage`. In `src/frontend/src/tabs`, add a new file called `Stage.jsx`, and paste the following code

```jsx filename="Stage.jsx" copy
// JavaScript, unlike Matlab, requires explicitly importing files
import React from "react";

const Stage = () => {
  return <div>It's a stage!</div>;
};

export default Stage;
```

`Stage` is a function which returns text to be displayed. We use `<div>` and `</div>`, which stands for divisor, to enclose our text to be displayed.

At the end, we export the `Stage` function so that it's accessible to other files.

Now, let's add the new stage tab to the file `src/frontend/src/hooks/useTabs.jsx`. First, import the new tab at the top of `useTabs.jsx`.

```jsx filename="useTabs.jsx" copy
import Stage from "./tabs/Stage";

// ...
```

Then, we put `Stage` in the `allTabs` object:

```jsx filename="useTabs.jsx" copy
// ...

let allTabs = {
  Main,
  Stage,
  // ...
};

// ...
```

Save the file, and head to `http://localhost:3000` in the browser. We should see our new stage tab!

### Connecting our stage to MATLAB

Let's now add controls for our stage. For this tutorial, we'll only control the x axis of the stage.

First, we'll pull the stage position variable from MATLAB. Let's update our `Stage.jsx` file to

```jsx filename="Stage.jsx" copy
import React from "react";
import { TextInput } from "../Utils"; // import the TextInput component from Utils.jsx
import { useMatlabVariable } from "../matlabComms/matlabHelpers";

const Stage = () => {
  const [pos, setPos] = useMatlabVariable("pos", "Stage"); // create a matlab-linked variable to store the position of the stage
  const x = pos.x; // extract the x position from the pos variable

  // create a function to update the x position of the stage
  function setX(newX) {
    setPos({ x: newPos });
  }

  console.log({ pos }); // print the stage position to the console

  return <div>It's a stage!</div>;
};

export default Stage;
```

We use the `useMatlabVariable` function to extract the `pos` property of the `Stage` MATLAB class.

We then create a function `setX` which updates the `x` property of the `pos` variable. We'll use this function later to update the stage position.

Finally, we print the stage position to the console. You can view the console by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + I` in the app.

### Updating the user interface with the stage position

Now, let's replace our text that is displayed with a component that shows the stage position.

```jsx filename="Stage.jsx" copy
import React from "react";
import { TextInput } from "../Utils"; // import the TextInput component from Utils.jsx
import { useMatlabVariable } from "../matlabComms/matlabHelpers";

const Stage = () => {
  const [pos, setPos] = useMatlabVariable("pos", "Stage"); // create a matlab-linked variable to store the position of the stage
  const x = pos.x; // extract the x position from the pos variable

  // create a function to update the x position of the stage
  function setX(newX) {
    setPos({ x: newPos });
  }

  // console.log({ pos }); // print the stage position to the console

  return (
    <div>
      <TextInput
        name="X"
        value={x}
        setValue={function (newX) {
          setX(newX);
        }} // when there is a change in the input box, update the state variable
        units="µm"
        className="w-24" // set the width of the input box to 24
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Stage;
```

We import the `TextInput` component from `Utils.jsx`. This component is a text field that allows us to input a number and units.

We pass the `x` value into the `TextInput` component by writing `value={x}`. We also pass a function into `setParameter`, which tells us how to update
the `x` variable when there is a change to the text field. Notice how we use `setX(newX)` instead of `x = newX`.

Finally, we set the width of the text field to 24 by adding `className="w-24"`. We can add additional styling to the component by adding more things to `className`.
For example `className="w-24 bg-red-700"` would set the text area to be red.
See the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/background-color#setting-the-background-color) for additional styles you can add.

And there we have it! A stage controller!
