<Steps>

### Install prerequisites

Download [NI-DAQmx](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daq-mx.html#480879), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

Make sure you're using MATLAB 2021a or a newer version.

Install all the required MATLAB toolboxes:

- Instrument Control Toolbox
- Optimization Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Data Acquisition Toolbox

### Clone the repo

Run the following in your terminal

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/adamcohenlab/luminos-microscopy.git
```

### Build the libraries

Open the `luminos` folder in Matlab, and build the C and JavaScript libraries by running the following in Matlab

```matlab copy
build
```
Note that this requires a copy of [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) to be installed.

### Create a NI DAQ simulator

Follow the [quick instructions here](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA03q000000x0PxCAI&l=en-US) to create a simulated NI DAQ. You can select the USB X Series 6363 DAQ. Alternatively, if you have an NI DAQ, plug it in.

Take note of the device name, which should be something like `Dev1`.

### Edit the initializer

Open the `Simulator.json` file (you can do this in MATLAB with `edit Simulator.json`). This file contains all the configuration data for your application. Replace all instances of `Dev1`
with the name of your device.

### Run the simulator app

Run the app in Matlab:

```matlab copy
app = Simulator_App();
```

There you have it! You should see a simulated camera with stripes, and luminos in the browser. Follow the next tutorial to hook up your hardware.
