Luminos is a MATLAB library for **bi-directional microscopy**: simultaneous high-speed imaging and patterned optical stimulation.

### Core features

- Built-in functions for stimulation via DMD, or galvo targeting, and detection via camera or point-scanning (confocal or 2P) techniques
- Simultaneous use of multiple stimulation and/or imaging modalities
- Complex experimental protocols, e.g. integration of animal behavior, targeted optogenetic stimulation, voltage imaging, and electrophysiology
- Maps all stimulation and recording devices to a single spatial and temporal coordinate system with sub-pixel and sub-frame registration accuracy.
- Saves comprehensive metadata on instrument state with every acquisition

### Architecture

- A modular Matlab core that allows for easy integration of arbitrary devices
- Intuitive and customizable UI written in JavaScript with [React](https://react.dev/)
- Low-level C++ code for high-speed data streaming and synchronization

### Hardware requirements

See [supported hardware](/supported-devices).
