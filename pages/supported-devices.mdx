# Supported Hardware

> You can write custom Matlab or C++ drivers for any hardware that is not currently supported.

#### Operating systems

- Windows. Tested on Windows 10, 11.

#### Cameras

- DCAM: [Hamamatsu](https://www.hamamatsu.com/eu/en/product/cameras.html) CMOS camears. Tested with Orca Flash 4.0 V2 and Orca Fusion.
- Teledyne Kinetix (https://www.teledynevisionsolutions.com/products/kinetix/?model=01-KINETIX-M-C)
- ANDOR CCD camera (limited support)

#### DAQs

- National Instruments DAQs. We've run with both PCIe and USB DAQs, but haven't tested with other bus technologies.

#### Digital micromirror devices

- ALP 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3: [Vialux](https://www.vialux.de/en/v-modules.html) DMDs. Tested with the Vialux V-7000.
- Texas Instruments DMDs. Tested with the DLP LightCrafter 4500.

#### Galvos (Experimental)

> Galvo support is an experimental feature and still under development.

- It should work with any galvo that hooks up to a DAQ by feeding x and y positions to two analog input ports
  and sending x and y waveforms via analog output ports. Tested with the Cambridge Technology 6215H galvos, and the Thorlabs GVS galvos.

#### Light sources

> Having software control of the laser is not crucial for using Luminos. You can turn off/on the lasers
> in hardware or with the vendor's software, and use shutters and modulators in Luminos.

- Coherent OBIS lasers
- Cobolt lasers. Tested with Cobolt 04-01 and 05-01 Series.
- Spectra-Physics DeepSee lasers
- Amplitude Mango OPA
- LED light sources under driver control

#### Stage controllers and other motion controllers

- Ludl MAC5000 & MAC6000 stage controller
- Scientifica SliceScope stage controller
- Sutter MPC200 stage controller
- Thorlabs DCServo TCube
- Thorlabs Stepper TCube
- Newport TRB25CC linear actuator motor

#### Spatial light modulators

- Meadowlark SLMs

#### Motorized filter wheels

- ASI filter wheel. Tested on the ASI FW1000.
- Optec high speed filter wheel.
- Thorlabs motorized filter wheels

#### Modulators

- G&H 8-channel acousto-optic tunable filter controller
- Thorlabs PRM1 motorized rotation mount
- Any Modulator that takes analog control input from a DAQ

#### Shutters

- Any shutter that connects to the NI DAQ

#### Analog data readout

- Device connected to DAQ AI port, e.g. thermocouples, piezos, photodiodes like Thorlabs DET series
